🚀 Maitri: An AI Assistant for Astronauts’ Emotional & Physical Well-Being
📌 Overview

Maitri is a multimodal AI assistant designed to continuously monitor and support astronauts during long-duration space missions.
It integrates audio, visual, and wearable sensor inputs to analyze emotional and physical states in real-time. Based on this, Maitri provides adaptive responses such as motivational prompts, relaxation techniques, and health alerts — all in an offline-first environment where internet may not be available.

🧩 Features

🎙️ Audio & Visual Input – Speech tone, pitch, and facial expression analysis.

⌚ Wearable Sensors – Tracks HRV, sleep cycles, and activity levels.

🧠 Emotion Classification – CNN-LSTM (audio), ResNet (visual), TCN/MLP (wearables).

🔗 Multimodal Fusion – Combines multiple inputs using weighted voting & attention.

💡 Adaptive Response – Delivers motivational talks, relaxation guidance, or stress alerts.

📊 Dashboard – Secure visualization of emotional trends and health indicators.

🛰️ Offline-First Operation – Works seamlessly in space or remote environments.
